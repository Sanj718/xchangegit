This is the implementation of the task in yii2/basic:
Following is a small task that you MUST complete in Yii2/basic. In case you are not able to complete it, email us whatever is done from the task. There are 3 entities; Company, Contact Person and Address. A company can have 1 or more contact persons. A contact person belongs to a company and will have 1 address. A company will have at least one default contact person . If more than one contact persons are added to a company, provide a way to make one of the contact person as default.

Using above entities and relationships;

- Design a database to store important information for all 3 entities
- Perform CRUD operations for the entities
- Allow listing of important information for all 3 entities
- Listing page for Company should display default contact person and contact person’s address along with other important information

INSTALLATION
Install via Composer
If you do not have Composer, you may install it by following the instructions at getcomposer.org.

You can then install this project template using the following command:

php composer.phar create-project --prefer-dist --stability=dev yiisoft/yii2-app-basic basic
Now you should be able to access the application through the following URL, assuming basic is the directory directly under the Web root.

http://localhost/basic/web/
Install from an Archive File
Extract the archive file downloaded from yiiframework.com to a directory named basic that is directly under the Web root.

Set cookie validation key in config/web.php file to some random secret string:

'request' => [
    // !!! insert a secret key in the following (if it is empty) - this is required by cookie validation
    'cookieValidationKey' => '<secret random string goes here>',
],
You can then access the application through the following URL:

http://localhost/basic/web/
CONFIGURATION
Database
Edit the file config/db.php with real data, for example:

return [
    'class' => 'yii\db\Connection',
    'dsn' => 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=yii2basic',
    'username' => 'root',
    'password' => '1234',
    'charset' => 'utf8',
];
NOTES:

Yii won't create the database for you, this has to be done manually before you can access it.
Check and edit the other files in the config/ directory to customize your application as required.
Refer to the README in the tests directory for information specific to basic application tests.
TESTING
Tests are located in tests directory. They are developed with Codeception PHP Testing Framework. By default there are 3 test suites:

unit
functional
acceptance
Tests can be executed by running

vendor/bin/codecept run
The command above will execute unit and functional tests. Unit tests are testing the system components, while functional tests are for testing user interaction. Acceptance tests are disabled by default as they require additional setup since they perform testing in real browser.

Running acceptance tests
To execute acceptance tests do the following:

Rename tests/acceptance.suite.yml.example to tests/acceptance.suite.yml to enable suite configuration

Replace codeception/base package in composer.json with codeception/codeception to install full featured version of Codeception

Update dependencies with Composer

composer update  
Download Selenium Server and launch it:

java -jar ~/selenium-server-standalone-x.xx.x.jar
In case of using Selenium Server 3.0 with Firefox browser since v48 or Google Chrome since v53 you must download GeckoDriver or ChromeDriver and launch Selenium with it:

# for Firefox
java -jar -Dwebdriver.gecko.driver=~/geckodriver ~/selenium-server-standalone-3.xx.x.jar

# for Google Chrome
java -jar -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=~/chromedriver ~/selenium-server-standalone-3.xx.x.jar
As an alternative way you can use already configured Docker container with older versions of Selenium and Firefox:

docker run --net=host selenium/standalone-firefox:2.53.0
(Optional) Create yii2_basic_tests database and update it by applying migrations if you have them.

tests/bin/yii migrate
The database configuration can be found at config/test_db.php.

Start web server:

tests/bin/yii serve
Now you can run all available tests

# run all available tests
vendor/bin/codecept run

# run acceptance tests
vendor/bin/codecept run acceptance

# run only unit and functional tests
vendor/bin/codecept run unit,functional
Code coverage support
By default, code coverage is disabled in codeception.yml configuration file, you should uncomment needed rows to be able to collect code coverage. You can run your tests and collect coverage with the following command:

#collect coverage for all tests
vendor/bin/codecept run -- --coverage-html --coverage-xml

#collect coverage only for unit tests
vendor/bin/codecept run unit -- --coverage-html --coverage-xml

#collect coverage for unit and functional tests
vendor/bin/codecept run functional,unit -- --coverage-html --coverage-xml
You can see code coverage output under the tests/_output directory.
